MysteryHouse game using Godot

This is a practice project based off the LoonyLips section of a Godot tutorial on Udemy called Discovering Godot by GameDev.tv.  The project is a text-based game based off of an old game I used to play on a Commodore 64.  I can't recall the name of the game.

The basics of the game is that you're in a large house and someone has been killed.  You need to explore the rooms to determine who has been killed, who the killer is and what weapon was used.  Since the killer has left the house with the weapon, it is a process of elimination.   Too make it slightly more challenging, the suspects move around the house periodically.

The game uses a JSON data file to define the rooms, suspects and weapons.
